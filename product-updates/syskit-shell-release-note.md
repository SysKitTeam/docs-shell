### Shell Features

#### PowerShell Modules

+ PowerShell modules are quick and easy way to do the task you need without writing PowerShell Scripts by yourself.
+ SysKit Shell has integrated support for browsing and installing modules from __PowerShell Gallery__.
+ You can customize execution of script and cmdlets from modules by supplying your own parameters sets.
+ If downloaded modules require __CredSSP__ to run their cmdlets or scripts SysKit Shell will handle that problem for you. All you have to do is to supply the credentials.
+ If you don't trust an online source you can always look at the source code by yourself, SysKit Shell will give you a direct link to see the script online before downloading it.
+ You don't have to install modules on all the servers where you plan to run them. SysKit Shell will prepare and deploy the files automatically from the server where SysKit Shell is installed.  
That way the servers you are monitoring do not require internet connection.

#### PowerShell Scripts

+ PowerShell Scripts within SysKit Shell are designed to make it as easy as possible for you to take control of and simplify the management of your Windows environments whether you are writing scripts or administering software.
+ This section includes __eighteen predefined PowerShell scripts__ categorized by their purpose.
+ Most of the available PowerShell scripts are tied to a specific server role— such as __Domain Controller__ and __SharePoint__, while others can run on all types of servers. It is very important to read the script description.
+ The __built-in PowerShell Script wizard__ brings syntax highlighting and colors to the editor and displays the results of the commands and scripts you have run. One of the key parts of the wizard is PowerShell script error handling, which is the same as in Windows PowerShell.
+ Our built-in PowerShell wizard supports __importing__ Windows PowerShell scripts with a __.ps1 extension__.
+ Created PowerShell scripts can be tied to a __specific server role__ and can be __executed__ for all or specific servers.
