# activation-privacy-statement

SysKit is asking you to activate your copy of the SysKit Shell so we may verify if your product was purchased legally. During the activation process, your personal data and your product key will not be sent to SysKit.

Activation is based on a number of factors that are being calculated during the activation processes. The activation process identifies only the computer, but it does not include the information about your software or data that resides on your computer, or any other information about your computer model or environment.

If you wish to perform your activation offline, please follow [these](../activation/online-offline-activation.md) instructions.
