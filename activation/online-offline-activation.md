### Online Activation

In order to activate your copy of the SysKit Monitor: Navigate to the Backstage screen by clicking on the __File__ tab, select __Help__ from the left toolbar, then click on the __Activate__ button and fill in all the required fields.

1. Login to our Customers Portal, navigate to the product key, and on the Activation dialog, write product key that has been provided to you upon purchase. The product key is a string in the following format XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXX and it consists of letters and numbers.
2. Click the __Activate__ button to start the key validation process. It only takes 2-5 seconds to perform the activation and it is a one-time-only procedure. If the validation of your key is successful, a green check mark will appear.

### Offline Activation

Customers that have no internet access on their computers will need to activate SysKit __manually__. In order to activate your copy of the SysKit Monitor manually, please navigate to the Backstage screen by clicking on the __File__ tab, select Help from the left toolbar, then click on the __Activate__ button and click on the offline activation link.

In order to create your activation files please follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the [Activation Page](https://my.syskit.com/activation/?P=SysKitMonitor).
2. Login to our Customers Portal, navigate to the product key, and on the activation page, write product key that has been provided to you upon purchase.
3. On the activation page, write your server name.
4. Download the license file.
5. Import the license file into SysKit Monitor and click the Activate button in the Activation dialog.
