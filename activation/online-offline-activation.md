## Online Activation

In order to activate your copy of the SysKit Shell **online**, please proceed with the following steps:

1. Navigate to the **About** dialog by clicking on the **Info** icon in the left upper corner, and then click the **Activate** button.
2. Fill in all the required fields by using the **email account** and **password**.

   > **Please note!** You need to change the **temporary password** that you received during your online purchase. These passwords are provided as initial passwords and are not meant for use.

3. Click the **Activate** button to start the email account validation process. It only takes 2-5 seconds to perform the activation and it is a one-time-only procedure. If the validation of your email address is successful, an info dialog will appear thanking you for the activation.

You can activate your license on a **purchased number of servers** while your subscription is active.

At any time you can login to our [Customers Portal](https://my.syskit.com) and navigate to the list of your licensed products.  
If you do not have the activation information, please [contact us](https://www.syskit.com/company/contact-us).

## Offline Activation

Customers that have no internet access on their servers will need to activate SysKit Shell **manually**. In order to activate your copy of the SysKit Shell manually, please proceed with the following steps:

1. Navigate to the **About** dialog by clicking on the **Info** icon in the left upper corner, and then click the **Activate** button.
2. In the Activate SysKit Shell dialog, click the **offline activation** link. In the newly opened activation dialog, follow these steps in order to create your activation files:
   * Click on the **Generate** button to generate a **License Details \(.dlic\) file**.
   * Navigate to the [Activation Page](https://my.syskit.com/activation/?P=Shell) and select the **Version** of SysKit Shell you are creating a license for.
   * On the Activation Page, login with your **email account** and **password**.

     > **Please note!** You need to change the **temporary password** that you received during your online purchase. These passwords are provided as initial passwords and are not meant for use.

   * Upload the **License Details \(.dlic\) file**.
   * Click the **Generate license file!** button and download the **license file \(.lic\)**.
3. Return to the SysKit Shell application and import the license file by clicking the **Browse...** button, locating your license file and opening it.
4. Click the **Activate** button to start the email account validation process. It only takes 2-5 seconds to perform the activation and it is a one-time-only procedure. If the validation of your email address is successful, an info dialog will appear thanking you for the activation.

   > **Please note!** The **license file \(.lic\)** is only valid for the user account and server where the **License Details \(.dlic\)** file was generated in step 2.

You can activate your license on a **purchased number of servers** while your subscription is active. Please keep in mind that the **License Details \(.dlic\) file** needs to be generated and on each server covered by your license, separately.

At any time you can login to our [Customers Portal](https://my.syskit.com) and navigate to the list of your licensed products.
